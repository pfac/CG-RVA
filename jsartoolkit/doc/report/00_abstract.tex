This document describes the implementation of a game based on the classic Pokémon\textsuperscript{\textregistered} using the JSARToolKit to allow player interactivity using Augmented Reality. Despite the lack of resources, the JSARToolKit was used to build a basic sample which allowed to place virtual elements together with a real-time image. The game was implemented using the markers as place for the monsters to appear allowing interaction by changing the marker visibility. Several features of the original game were replicated, such as the capture system, the evolution and the Pokédex.
