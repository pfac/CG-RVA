The webcam stream is an essencial part of this project. Yet, obtaining this stream in a web browser is still an experimental feature, not widely available. This project was particularly tested and designed for the \textit{Google Chrome}\footnote{\url{http://chrome.google.com}}. The standard used in this project was designed (and at the date of this document it is still in development) by the WebRTC (Real-time Communications) initiative\footnote{\url{http://www.webrtc.org/home}}. At the date, to obtain a WebRTC enabled binary of Google Chrome, a canary build must be obtained (links in the WebRTC website).

To test this project, it is required that the \texttt{MediaStream} flag is activated in the browser. This can be done temporarily by calling the Google Chrome (RTC) executable with the argument \texttt{--enable-media-stream}, or permanently by acessing the address \url{chrome://flags} and enabling the flag in that page (the process can be reverted in the same page). After this, when acessing the game page, a bar will appear below the Favorites, asking if the user allows the browser to use the webcam. Allowing will start the game.
