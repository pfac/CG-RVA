\SubSection{POKÉDEX}
\label{sec:pokedex}

In the original game, the player is able to keep track of the Pokémons he/she has caught using the Pokédex, a fictional device which records the informations about all the seen and caught Pokémons in a numbered list.

Since a similar logic feature was required to implement the evolution system, a \texttt{table} tag was added to the page of the game with the scoreboard of each Pokémon. This table is automatically updated using the Document Object Model\footnote{(DOM) Convention used to access the elements of an HTML page using an object-oriented paradigm, regarding the scripting language used.} methods.
