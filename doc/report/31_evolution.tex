In order to simulate the process of evolution, the concept of leveling is changed to that of how many times a Pokémons has been caught. The evolved forms of a Pokémon are locked until that Pokémons is captured a certain number of times. Formally, when a Pokémon is selected in the Marker state, if the number of times the previous form has been caught is greater than the lock value, the Pokémon is accepted.
